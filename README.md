# SocialApe

SocialApe is a serverless social media application developed and deployed using Firebase (Google Cloud). It features all the functionality that you would expect from a social media application, such as account creation/login, content upload, profile customization, comments, likes, etc. 

I developed this application with the purpose of learning about cloud technologies, Node Express and ReactJs. Therefore, the architecture used is client server, with a ReactJs client and a google cloud functions based REST API implemented using express. For the implementation of other features such as IAM, SMTP, database and object storage I decided to use Firebase. 

Moreover, the project is also hosted and publicly available [here](https://social-app-sd.web.app/).
